Consider the hypothetical case of a man who can
have anything he wants just by wishing for it. Such a man
has power, but he will develop serious psychological problems. At first he will have a lot of fun, but by and by he
will become acutely bored and demoralized. Eventually he
may become clinically depressed. History shows that leisured aristocracies tend to become decadent. This is not true
of fighting aristocracies that have to struggle to maintain
their power. But leisured, secure aristocracies that have no
need to exert themselves usually become bored, hedonistic and demoralized, even though they have power. This
shows that power is not enough. One must have goals toward which to exercise oneâ€™s power
